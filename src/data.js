God created the heavens and the earth.
Now the earth was formless and empty,
darkness was over the surface of the deep,
and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.

an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death;
and Hades was following with him Authority was given to
them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and

of the earth.
